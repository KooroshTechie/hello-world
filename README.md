This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I recently completed my Master of Engineering in Renewable Energy Systems at Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences, where I focused on advancing sustainable energy solutions. My master's thesis explored Evaluating and Optimizing Energy Infrastructure Renovation using the practical
example of a property of SWG mbH with OEMOF, and this experience has solidified my passion for energy modeling, energy simulation, and optimizing building performance.

Currently, I work as a working student at a real estate company, where I specialize in energy simulation, energy analysis, and building certification. My role allows me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects, helping to create more energy-efficient and sustainable buildings. I am particularly passionate about using advanced simulation tools to model energy consumption, assess the environmental impact, and identify opportunities for energy savings.

With a strong foundation in renewable energy systems, I am now focused on deepening my expertise in energy modeling and simulation. I am eager to contribute to projects that leverage these skills to drive innovation in sustainable building design and renewable energy integration.

I am proficient in energy modeling, Python, data science, OEMOF, and I excel in environments that challenge me to solve complex problems and think critically about sustainability.

I am always open to connecting with professionals who share my passion for renewable energy and sustainable development. Please feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities or collaborations in these fields.
